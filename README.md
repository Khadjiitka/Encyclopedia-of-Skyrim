# Encyclopedia-of-Skyrim
This repository contains my personal educational project — an interactive web encyclopedia inspired by The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.<br>
The project is developed as part of my Web Design course in University, where I study modern approaches to UI/UX, layout structuring, responsive design, and visual styling. <br>

The main goal of this project is to create a visually rich, atmospheric website dedicated to the world of Skyrim, including its guilds, magic, races, factions, creatures, weapons, and history. <br>

<i> ⚠️ The project is currently in progress. 
Many pages are still being redesigned, optimized, or recreated based on my new Figma layouts.</i>

##  Project Description

The site is designed as a multi-page encyclopedia with:

- atmospheric backgrounds and blurred fog overlays

- side navigation menus

- category-based galleries with hover animations

- sections for guilds, magic, races, maps, bestiary, and more

- consistent medieval-inspired typography

- adaptive structure for future mobile optimization

Each page aims to recreate the unique feeling of the Skyrim universe while remaining clean and user-friendly.

## 🎨 Design & Prototyping (Figma)
Below are some previews of the planned redesigns.
These Figma screens demonstrate the structure, future improvements, and general visual direction of the project
